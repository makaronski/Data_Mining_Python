# Machine Learning problems with Python

* Data Mining and Decision Support Systems course in WU-Vienna homeworks and project work - Summer Semester 2018.
  * The focus of the course was to understand the way the learning algorithms work under the hood, without using the pre-defined functios in the libraries. 
* Kaggle competition - MNIST dataset - Image Classification 
  * First try using Random Forest Classifier - 93% accuracy. Next, I will try with a CNN for better results.
